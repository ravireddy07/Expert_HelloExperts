# Problem Description

* Review the Prezi on Miguel Pinero, author of Short Eyes and co-founder of the Nuyorican Poet's Cafe.  Pinero wrote this award-winning play while imprisoned.  Funding for literacy and arts-based programs in prison has declined in the last several decades after what has been characterized as an "arts prison renaissance" of the 1990s. 

* What do you think is the purpose of prison?  Is there a gap between what prisons are supposed to do and what they do? What's your opinion about using art to help rehabilitate prisoners?  What can that look like and who does it benefit? Consider Miguel Pinero here in your response. Should there be limitations to prison programs?  If so, what and why?  Lastly, who benefits from the Prison Industrial Complex? 

* This topic always brings a range of responses and usually strong emotions.  All opinions are valid here.  Please post early this week so that we can respond to each other -- having a conversation about this topic is useful.

* Your response should be 1-2 well-written and constructed paragraphs that use examples from the course content and your personal opinions and experience to illustrate your points. 

* Do not use the internet to answer this or any questions for this class (beyond reviewing the online course material).

# Discussion

## Introduction 

>**Miguel Pinero** (1946 – 1988) was a playwright, actor and co-founder of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. He was a leading member of the Nuyorican literary movement. His father abandoned the family in 1954 when his mother was pregnant with their fifth child. His mother then moved into a basement and began receiving welfare.  He would steal food for his family to eat. His first of many criminal convictions came at the age of eleven, for theft. He was sent to the Juvenile Detention Center in the Bronx, and to Otisville State Training School for Boys. He joined a street gang called **The Dragons** when he was 13, when he was 14, he was hustling in the streets.

>He moved to Brooklyn, where he and three other friends committed robberies, until they were caught at a jewelry store. He was sent to Rikers Island in 1964. After this, he joined the Job Corps, and was sent to Camp Kilmer for training. It turned out the opportunity was, as Piñero put it, "Dope City, Skag Town." He returned to New York City and became affiliated with the Young Lords, a group similar to the Black Panthers. He was back in Rikers for drug possession not long after, and spent time at Phoenix House. After his second stint at Rikers, his mother sent him to Manhattan State Hospital, where he would receive his high-school equivalency diploma.



## About Miguel Pinero, Towards Short Eyes

>In 1972, when Pinero was 25 years old, he was incarcerated in Sing Sing prison for second-degree armed robbery. His first literary work was Black Woman with a Blonde Wig On. Marvin Felix Camillo, the director of The Family, an acting troupe made up of ex-cons, submitted the poem to a contest, which it won. The warden of Sing Sing then became concerned that "contraband" was being taken from the prison and nearly put Camillo in jail after seeing an article in the newspaper. While serving time in prison, he wrote the play Short Eyes as part of the inmates' playwriting workshop. Mel Gussow came to see it, and due to his review in the New York Times, the director of the Theater at Riverside Church wanted Piñero to present it there.

>When he left Sing Sing due to parole in 1973, he was able to present Short Eyes with The Family. The title comes from "short heist", the prison slang term for child molestation. Puerto Ricans could not pronounce the 'h' so it became "short eyes." The play is a drama based on his experiences in prison and portrays how a house of detention populated primarily by black and Latino inmates is affected by the incarceration there of a white pedophile, considered the lowest form of prison life. In 1974, the play was presented at Riverside Church in Manhattan. Theater impresario Joseph Papp saw the play and was so impressed that he moved the production to Broadway. It went from Riverside Church,then to The Public Theater, eventually to Vivian Beaumont Theater. The play was nominated for six Tony Awards. It won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award and an Obie Award for the "best play of the year". The play was also a success in Europe. The play catapulted Piñero to literary fame. Short Eyes was published in book form by the editorial house Hill & Wang. It became the first play written by a Puerto Rican to be put on Broadway.


>In and out of jail, he took drugs and sold drugs, and whenever he had money, it "went into my veins." At one point he tried to be rehabilitated at Phoenix House, and subsequently, he joined the Young Lords as "a Lord in training."
Occasionally he worked at regular jobs, "pushing a rack" in the garment district, in the photostat department at Metro‐Goldwyn‐Mayer. "One time I got a job at 9 A.M. and was fired at noon. I was making guitar strings and I was strung out." The last crime he committed was a burglary and armed robbery on an apartment house (ironically, it is two blocks from the Public Theater). At 4 A.M. he and two accomplices broke in, made everyone sit on the floor and then ran out with television sets and shopping bags full of loot. A police officer caught them at the corner. At Mr. Pifiero's trial, two of his victims testified, he remembered, "that I was the nicest burglar they ever met." Mr. Pinero insists that he never hurt anyone, except “in gang fights, or when it was a question of either hurt or get hurt." But he admitted that he had no sympathy for his victims. “I never thought about what they needed the money for. I knew what needed it for." He received a five‐year sentence and was shipped off to Sing Sing. Aged 24, he faced his longest sentence. "I was confuqecl. I don't know what would happen to me. knew it was going to be hard and I would get by. I knew was not going to die there, but I didn't care."



#### What's your opinion about using art to help rehabilitate prisoners ?

>Open any book on crime and punishment today and one of the first chapters will include a discussion of the decline of the rehabilitative ideal and the shift towards a more punitive criminal justice system. These chapters often note that between the 1950s and 1970s, the ideal model of correctional administration founded on the belief that trained experts could administer individualized assessment and treatment that would 'diagnose' and 'treat' the causes of criminality in the way that medical doctors were able to cure other forms of illness. This medical model of inmate services was referred to as the 'rehabilitative ideal', a correctional philosophy deeply rooted in the idea that prison inmates could be reformed and returned to the free world as law-abiding citizens, and was crucial to the development of correctional professionals and most corrections departments across the U.S. throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Many in the field believed that the rehabilitative ideal would be the paradigm for corrections indefinitely and that penal reformers would be able to craft increasingly technical and sophisticated prison environments and programs(Garland 2001). However, to the shock of many observers, precisely the opposite happened; starting in the early 1970s, rehabilitation was publicly discredited, making rehabilitation 'a dirty word' corrections departments turned to drastically different rhetorical strategies to justify their existence; and the sentencing structures that undergirded the rehabilitative ideal were dismantled(Ward & Maruna 2007). Much of the scholarly work in the field since that point has attempted to grapple with how and why this shift took place. For the purposes of this article, these perspectives are important because they highlight different explanations for the near-universal assumption that prison programs for inmates were eliminated alongside the demise of the rehabilitative ideal.

>One of the most direct explanations of this shift is that the rehabilitative ideal was discredited by a lack of evidence that prison treatment programs could reduce recidivism and political attacks on the determinant sentencing model.


#### What can that look like and who does it benefit & who benefits from the Prison Industrial Complex ?

**Traditional Industries Work Programs**
>In the traditional industry prison work programs, inmates manufacture or service goods such as name plates, attresses, desks, shelving, seating, bookcases and more.These items are sold to state, county and municipal offices school districts, and nonprofit organizations.This hands-on work offers the inmate training on a specific skill that provides them with ways to return to society and contribute as well as earn a wage.While incarcerated, the working inmate offsets their cost of incarceration. They earn a small wage while creating a product that can be purchased at substantial savings by businesses and organizations.

**Prison Industry Enhancement Work Programs**
>This created a unique prison work program that allowed inmates to work for private companies.Specifically, outside private companies can submit to all the necessary requirements and then be exempt from federal restrictions on prisoner-made goods. This is beneficial to the company as well as the inmates employed by the company. 
According to the Department of Corrections, "The program places inmates in realistic work environments, pays them prevailing wages, and gives them a chance to develop marketable skills that will increase their potential for rehabilitation and meaningful employment on release."



* The benefits of prison work programs go much deeper than just job training.

* If your loved one is currently incarcerated with access to a prison work program, speaking to them about their options may help determine if a particular program is the right one.

* Studies have been conducted to show that both TI and PIE better prepare an inmate for re-entry than OTW (Other-Than-Work) programs. However, upon release, inmates participating in any of these three programs are at an advantage than those who do not.

* In the most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics census of the prison population, we learn that 88% of the nation’s correctional facilities offer some kind of prison work program.

* This data concludes that the majority of the inmates are likely participating in OTW responsibilities such as washing dishes or doing laundry. Or, TI programs producing items like license plates.

* The benefits of these programs include:

> * preparation for handling responsibility outside of the correctional facility
> * practical and functional life skills-training
> * general technical skills knowledge
> * The data tells us that less than 5% of the total inmate population work in PIE roles.

* The obvious benefit to a PIE job is the increased pay and bonus opportunities. For example, PIE programs in Colorado can bring in up to $400 per month. That’s a large sum considering the average hourly pay is around $0.25 across the Nation.

* Additional benefits to prison work programs are called soft skills. These skills, unlike technical skills, help to prepare an inmate to become a functional member of society above and beyond their professional life.

* Inmates are able to practice and implement soft skills that can include:

> * timeliness
> * respecting authority figures
> * comprehension of directions
> * the value of teamwork
> * taking pride in one’s accomplishments


## Society and Market talks

> * This powerful drama of prison life is set in a house of detention where a group of young convicts-predominantly black and Puerto Rican-taunt, fight, insult, and entertain one another in an attempt to preserve their sanity and to create a semblance of community. When a young white prisoner accused of child molesting is thrown into the cell block by a guard who says he belongs in Sing Sing because "the men up there konw what to do with degenerates like you," the stage is set for an explosive series of events; for, among prisoners, this child molester called "short eyes" is the lowest of criminals.

> * This was a real dark, nasty play that speaks directly to the ghetto experience. I wanted to teach it to a high school class, but my boss said no way - far too violent, too much bad language and prison homosex. The author was a legitimate convict himself - a small-time thief and drug fiend who died of AIDS (I think) at the age of 35-40. This play was something that he started in a prison writing class, and while he may have been a hoodlum, he could really write. This is very potent, intense stuff all the way thru - it is a harrowing journey, but one worth taking. Pinero had an excellent sense of drama and tension, and this play is brimming with both. The story focuses on a group of toughs in a New York State penitentiary. Most of them are Black, a couple are Hispanic, and one is an Irish-American. One of them is an attractive young man who keeps getting hit on by a predatory gay convict. Another has adopted a half-baked radical philosophy. Into this mix comes Clark, a quiet, seemingly respectable upper middle-class white man, who has no business being there except that he is a "short eyes" - a child molester. The tension grows as it becomes clear that some of the other inmates want to kill him or at least turn his life into a hell. At one point, Clark confesses in great detail to another inmate - he is a hardcore, serial child molester and Pinero sticks the knife in and turns it as he describes the little girls falling for Clark and thinking of him as a boyfriend or something. I have seen several movies or plays that depict prison life, but this one is the best. It is dark and brutal, but also totally believable.

> * Neither long nor difficult, this was still a hard book for me to read as it presents prison life with shocking honesty. Vivid language, strong characters, and even sympathetic scenes all surprised me. Very well written drama! I'm preparing for my upcoming classes and find myself rereading earlier materials; this is not pleasant by any means, but I'm glad I reread it just now.

> * Many more....


## My thoughts

* Mr. Pinero watches his play almost every night and greets friends later. "I met more ex‐cons I knew at the joint since I came down here," he said. "And a lot of brothers write to me from state prisons."

* Since he has been on parole, he has been reading and seeing plays, and is working on a new one. He would like to act again—he and the entire cast of “Short Eyes” have recently become members of Actors Equity.

* He is also interested in writing screenplays, to help his "Rican brothers". "The only way we exist is stereotype militants chasing Eddie Egan. We only exist as dope fiends, dope pushers, or fanatical revolutionaries. If I ever get into writing scripts, I want to bring in some Puerto Rican heroes, which our youth can identify with even if it's only a kung fu quickie where a Puerto Rican strikes one blow".

* Most importantly, he would like to help in prisons. "I want to set up programs where guys like myself can give something. We identify—like role modelship. They can say, 'Here comes a brother from the joint.' We're on the same level."

> * Looking back on his life to date, Mr. Pinero said, "It was not really wasted, but I lost a lot of years. I've done a lot of growing up in the last two years".
