# Problem Description

* Review the Prezi on Miguel Pinero, author of Short Eyes and co-founder of the Nuyorican Poet's Cafe.  Pinero wrote this award-winning play while imprisoned.  Funding for literacy and arts-based programs in prison has declined in the last several decades after what has been characterized as an "arts prison renaissance" of the 1990s. 

* What do you think is the purpose of prison?  Is there a gap between what prisons are supposed to do and what they do? What's your opinion about using art to help rehabilitate prisoners?  What can that look like and who does it benefit? Consider Miguel Pinero here in your response. Should there be limitations to prison programs?  If so, what and why?  Lastly, who benefits from the Prison Industrial Complex? 

* This topic always brings a range of responses and usually strong emotions.  All opinions are valid here.  Please post early this week so that we can respond to each other -- having a conversation about this topic is useful.

* Your response should be 1-2 well-written and constructed paragraphs that use examples from the course content and your personal opinions and experience to illustrate your points. 

* Do not use the internet to answer this or any questions for this class (beyond reviewing the online course material).
